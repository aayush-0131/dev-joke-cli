# --- Key Decisions & Approach ---
# 1. Typer: We're using Typer to create our Command-Line Interface (CLI) app.
#    It's modern, easy to use, and automatically generates help text.
#    The `@app.command()` decorator turns a regular function into a CLI command.
# 2. Rich: This library is for making the output beautiful. We use `Console` to
#    handle printing and `Panel` to draw a nice box around our joke.
# 3. Requests: A standard, reliable library for making HTTP requests to the API.
# 4. API: We are using the "Official Joke API" which is free and requires no API key,
#    making our project simple and easy to run.

# Initialize the Typer app and Rich console
app = typer.Typer()
console = Console(force_terminal=True)

# Define the URL for the programming jokes API
API_URL = "https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/random"

def joke():
    """
    Fetches a random programming joke and displays it in a formatted panel.
    """
    try:
        # Use a "spinner" to show the user that something is happening
        with console.status(
            "[bold green]Fetching a joke for you...", spinner="dots"
        ) as status:
            # Make the API request
            response = requests.get(API_URL)
            # Raise an exception if the request was unsuccessful (e.g., 404, 500)
            response.raise_for_status()

            # The API returns a list containing a single joke object
            joke_data = response.json()[0]
